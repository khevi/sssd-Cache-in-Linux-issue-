SSSD stores its cache files in the /var/lib/sss/db/ directory.

While using the sss_cache command is preferable, it is also possible to clear the cache by simply deleting the corresponding cache files.

Before doing this it is suggested that the SSSD service be stopped.

systemctl stop sssd

rm -rf /var/lib/sss/db/*

systemctl restart sssd

You acn also use cleared with the sss_cache utility
The -E flag can be used to invalidate all cached entries, with the exception of sudo rules

sss_cache -E

sss_cache -u user1
